Er, well, be a fledgling one, anyway.\r\n\r\nAlso included is Barnabus, a lovely genderqueer pet who uses different pronouns every playthrough and will phase into reality to purr against your leg!\n\nThis mod is compatible with both the mainline game, and the beta branch (as of writing: version 2.0.201.7).  If you have troubles loading the mod on the beta version, make sure you enable the mod, then restart your game due to a mod bug in beta!\r\n\nThis mod is compatible with the current beta\n\r\nIf the mod ever creates a save incompatibility, you can find specific releases here and override the Steam Workshop version:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vahnj/CavesOfQudAstralKitty\n\nOther contributor: TBExtent","Tags":"Astral Kitty,Genotype,Pet","Visibility":"2","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
